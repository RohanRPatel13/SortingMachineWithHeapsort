# SortingMachineWithHeapsort

## Objectives
1. Familiarity with writing a kernel class for a new type and its kernel operations (SortingMachine layered on Queue and arrays, using heapsort).
2. Familiarity with developing and using specification-based test plans.

## The Problem
The problem is to complete and carefully test implementations of the constructor and all kernel methods defined in interface SortingMachineKernel, building the data structure representing a SortingMachine object by layering it on top of Queue and arrays. The algorithmic approach is to use the heapsort sorting algorithm discussed in class.
